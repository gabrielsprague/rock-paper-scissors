# rock-paper-scissors
Introduction: 
Gonna be doing my first bit of javascript to create
the good old game of rock-paper-scissors.

Note, the first version is going to be exclusively
pinned to the developer console as I haven't instructions
to move into user interface, yet.

Observations:
Going to have to clean up some functions with all the lines
that the script has to run through.
